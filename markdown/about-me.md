I am a researcher and biomedical engineer with 5+ years of design, data analysis, and machine learning experience, with a passion for advancing healthcare through exceptional data-driven user experiences. My current research uses wearable cameras and computer vision to better inform clinical decision-making in outpatient neurorehabilitation. Outside work, you can find me playing basketball, bouldering, snowboarding, or spending time with my German Shepherd, Spyro.
